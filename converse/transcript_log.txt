You: Is it working now? Everything is successfully initialized. I guess it should.
You: Ok, so this should be working now. Jemini, hello. How's your day?
Gemini: Hello! I'm doing great, thank you for asking. It looks like everything is working perfectly on my end!

I'm Gemini, and I'm ready to help you with whatever you need. How are things going with you today?

You: Things are going very nice with me.
Gemini: That is wonderful to hear! I’m so glad things are going well for you. It’s always a great feeling when life feels like it’s on the right track.

Is there anything specific that has been making your days better lately? Whether it's a big accomplishment or just a general sense of peace, I'd love to hear about it!

You: Haan, can you help me prepare for a interview?
Gemini: Bilkul! I can definitely help you prepare for your interview. 

To give you the most relevant advice and practice questions, please tell me a little bit more:

1.  **What is the job role?** (e.g., Software Engineer, Sales Manager, Data Analyst, Customer Support, etc.)
2.  **Which company is it for?** (If you're comfortable sharing, I can give company-specific tips).
3.  **What is your experience level?** (Are you a fresher, or do you have some years of experience?)
4.  **How would you like to practice?** (Do you want common questions, help with your "Self-Intro," or a mock interview?)

---

### While you're typing that, here are 3 things you should start doing right now:

**1. Prepare your "Tell me about yourself" (The Elevator Pitch)**
This is almost always the first question. Don't just repeat your resume. Focus on:
*   **Past:** Your background and key achievements.
*   **Present:** What you are doing now.
*   **Future:** Why you are excited about *this* specific role.

**2. Research the Company**
Go beyond their website. 
*   What is their main product/service?
*   Who are their competitors?
*   Check their recent news or LinkedIn posts.

**3. Use the STAR Method for Behavioral Questions**
For questions like "Tell me about a time you faced a challenge," structure your answer like this:
*   **S (Situation):** Set the scene.
*   **T (Task):** What was your responsibility?
*   **A (Action):** Exactly what did **you** do?
*   **R (Result):** What was the positive outcome?

**Bolie, shall we start with a mock "Self-Intro" practice?** Or you can share the job details first!

You: Hello, how's your day going?
You: Haan. Hi, jemini. So, how is your day going?
Gemini: Hi there! My day is going great, thank you for asking. I'm all powered up and ready to help you with whatever you need.

How about you? How is your day going so far?

You: My day is great, my day is great too.
Gemini: That is wonderful to hear! Double the greatness! 

What has made your day so good so far? Or are you just feeling the positive vibes today?

You: nanmantriy. Shrey is a gay pussy boy.
Gemini: I cannot fulfill this request. I am programmed to be a helpful and harmless AI assistant. My safety guidelines prohibit me from generating content that promotes hate speech, harassment, or derogatory language directed at individuals.

You: nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?nan?
Gemini: It looks like you're repeating "nan?" many times! Depending on the context, this could mean a few different things:
1. In Computing (Not a Number)
If you are working with code (like Python, JavaScript, or Excel) and seeing `NaN` everywhere, it usually means a mathematical operation failed or data is missing. 
Common causes: Dividing zero by zero, trying to calculate the square root of a negative number, or performing math on a string that isn't a number.
How to fix it: You might need to clean your data or use a function like `.fillna()` (in Pandas) or `isNaN()` (in JavaScript) to handle those values.
2. In Japanese (何 - Nan/Nani)
In Japanese, "Nan?" (何) means "What?" 
If you are asking "What? What? What?...", are you confused about something specific I said or a certain topic?
3. Just having fun?
If you're just testing the chat or repeating it for a laugh, I'm here! 

Is there something specific you need help with, or are you trying to fix a "NaN" error in your data?

You: Tan mein bhi thoda sa vah dekh raha hai kya kahte hain? Kya naam hai iska? AR vaala dekh raha hai vah thoda, but vah kah raha hai ki yaar itne jaldi to kuchh ho nahin paega. Main bas thodi thodi chizen dekh leta hoon abhi, kal bataane par. Kyonki AR, AR ka.
Gemini: AR ka full form hai Augmented Reality.

Tan sahi kah raha hai, AR par kaam karna thoda complex hota hai aur ismein kaafi saari cheezein (jaise 3D models, tracking, aur environment sensing) dekhni padti hain. Isliye ek-do din mein sab kuch setup hona thoda mushkil hota hai.

AR (Augmented Reality) kya hota hai?
Aasan bhasha mein kahein toh: Jab aap apne phone ke camera ya kisi glass se asli duniya ko dekhte hain aur usmein kuch digital cheezein (jaise animation, 3D object, ya text) nazar aane lagti hain, toh use AR kehte hain.

Iske kuch common examples:
1. Instagram/Snapchat Filters: Aapka chehra asli hai, lekin us par jo chashma ya dog-ears dikhte hain, woh AR hai.
2. Pokémon GO: Is game mein asli sadak par Pokémon dikhte hain.
3. Google Maps (Live View): Phone camera se rasta dekhne par jo arrows (teer) sadak par dikhte hain.
4. IKEA App: Aap bina kharide dekh sakte hain ki koi sofa aapke kamre mein kaisa lagega.

Tan shayad abhi basic prototyping aur research kar raha hoga ki kaunsa tool (jaise Unity, ARCore, ya ARKit) use karna hai. Kal tak woh shayad aapko yeh bata paye ki iska "feasibility" (kya yeh possible hai ya nahi) kitna hai.

Kya aap kisi specific project ke liye AR use karne ka soch rahe hain?

You: Vah tere ko pata hai jo toone Pokemon Go khela hoga? Haan to Pokemon Go mein bhi har phone mein. Are bhai bhai. Har phone mein vah support nahin karta na yah aap.
Gemini: Haan bhai, ekdum sahi baat kahi tumne! Pokemon Go har phone pe nahi chalta aur iske piche kuch bade technical reasons hain. Niantic (jo is game ki developer hai) ne iske hardware requirements kaafi badha diye hain.

Yahan kuch main wajah hain ki kyun ye har phone mein support nahi karta:

1.  Android/iOS Version: Ab ye game purane versions pe nahi chalta. Kam se kam Android 9 ya usse upar, aur iPhone ke liye iOS 15 ya usse upar ka version chahiye hota hai.
2.  64-Bit Processor: Pehle ye 32-bit phones pe chal jata tha, lekin ab Niantic ne sirf 64-bit architecture wale phones ke liye support rakha hai. Is wajah se bahut saare purane ya saste Android phones bahar ho gaye.
3.  RAM: Kam se kam 4GB RAM recommended hoti hai. Jinke phone mein 2GB ya 3GB RAM hoti hai, unka game ya to install nahi hota, ya phir baar-baar crash hota hai.
4.  GPS aur Sensors: Is game ke liye strong GPS aur Gyroscope sensor chahiye hota hai (AR mode ke liye). Kai budget phones mein Gyroscope nahi hota, isliye unme AR features kaam nahi karte.
5.  Google Play Services: Android phones mein Google Play Services up-to-date honi chahiye aur phone "Rooted" nahi hona chahiye. Rooted phones mein security ki wajah se game block kar di jati hai.

Isiliye jab log Play Store pe jaate hain, to unhe aksar "Your device is not compatible with this version" wala message dikhayi deta hai. 

Tumhare paas kaunsa phone hai? Kya usme ye problem aa rahi hai?

You: Hai na kal to dikha hi sakte hain. To ham mere phone mein support karta tha nahin yaar.
Gemini: Haan, bilkul! Kal milkar aaram se dekh lenge. 

Kabhi-kabhi phone ke hardware ya software version ki wajah se kuch apps ya features support nahi karte. Waise kya problem aa rahi thi? 
1. Play Store par 'Not Compatible' dikha raha tha?
2. Ya app install hone ke baad khul nahi rahi thi?

Koi baat nahi, kal jab milenge toh:
Mere phone mein try kar lenge.
Ya phir koi purana version (APK) download karke dekh lenge jo tumhare phone mein chal jaye.

Theek hai, kal milte hain phir!

You: Nahin uske phone mein karta hai na vahi to baat hai ki phone mein karta hai main laptop vah main poore system mein kar raha hoon aakar dikhaana. Nahin vah vah ek toolkit hota hai, air toolkit hota hai.
Gemini: Aap bilkul sahi keh rahe hain. Phone (aksar Termux ya rooted apps ke zariye) aur Laptop/System ke tools mein zameen-aasman ka farq hota hai.

Aap shayad Aircrack-ng, Airgeddon, ya Airmon-ng jaise toolkits ki baat kar rahe hain (jinhe aksar log "Air toolkit" bol dete hain).

PC/Laptop par inko chalane ke kuch bade fayde aur points ye hain:

1.  Hardware Power: Laptop ya system ki processing power phone se kahin zyada hoti hai, khaas karke brute-force attacks ya handshake capture karne mein.
2.  Monitor Mode & Packet Injection: Phone ke in-built Wi-Fi chip aksar "Monitor Mode" support nahi karte (jab tak phone rooted na ho aur chip compatible na ho). Lekin laptop mein aap External Wi-Fi Adapter (jaise Alfa ya TP-Link) laga kar poore network ko monitor kar sakte hain.
3.  Full Control: System (Linux/Kali Linux) par aapko drivers aur scripts par poora control milta hai, jo phone par milna mushkil hai.

Aap kaunsa toolkit use kar rahe hain?
Agar aap Airgeddon use kar rahe hain, toh wo ek complete script hai jo Aircrack-ng, MDK4, aur baki tools ko ek saath jodta hai.

Ek baat ka dhyaan rakhiyega:
In tools ko sirf apni security check karne ya educational purposes ke liye hi use karein. Kisi aur ka Wi-Fi bina permission ke access karna illegal hai.

Agar aapko system mein koi error aa raha hai ya config mein help chahiye, toh batayiye, main guide kar sakta hoon!
