# Ranking-Supervised Behavioral Video Model

This project implements the training pipeline for a ranking-supervised video model based on the RecruitView dataset. The goal is to learn a latent video representation that preserves human ranking order.

This project is built by a Gemini CLI coding agent and follows the `PROCESS.md` strictly.
