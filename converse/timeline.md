- Project directory structure created and explained.
- Placeholder Go files created.
- Go module initialized with 'github.com/user/converse'.
- Implemented a minimal runnable version with audio capture and VAD.
- Resolved environment setup issues (MinGW, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, GOROOT).
- Tuned VAD sensitivity and cleaned up logging for a smoother user experience.
- Resolved `FileNotFoundError` race condition for temporary audio files.
- Fixed missing `encoder.Close()` for valid WAV file generation.
- **Major Simplification:** Refactored project to remove VAD and server logic, switching to a simple 10-second time-based transcription loop as per user request.
